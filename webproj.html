                        <p>This was our first project of the year. My group had to make a website for an endangered species. My part of the project was to do the home page and most of the css. Since at the time I was the one of the few that knew basic css, my team had a little bit of an advantage but we still had a lot improving to do. We had a really big problem with media queries and we could never get them the way we wanted it to look. The whole point of this project was to reinforce our html coding skills which is exactly what it did.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>This project was our first big team collaboration. It was our whole class working on one website. It got very hectic very fast. Git helped a lot in this development process. My part of the project was to work on the digital securities info. We had many conflicts when merging with git. This is when lines of code does not merge correctly and you have to go in and manually fix it. That was the biggest challenge of the project was all of the conflicts.</p>

                        <p>Git is an important tool to use when you are working in a big group on the same project. Git allows you to collaborate in teams anywhere in the world. It also combines the code for you so you donâ€™t have to. During the year we have learned to praise git. It is a very helpful tool to use when working in teams.</p>
